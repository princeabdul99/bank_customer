# Project Background
**Bank Customer Churn**

Account information for 10,000 customers at a European bank, including details on their credit score, balance, products, and whether they have churned.

This project utilizes data visualization techniques to uncover insights into customer churn and behavior within a bank.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Churn Attributes and Predictability:** dentifying attributes that are more prevalent among churners compared to non-churners and assessing the predictive power of the available variables.
- **Customer Demographics:** Analyzing the overall demographic profile of the bankâ€™s customers to understand key characteristics. 
- **Regional Behavior Differences:** Exploring account behavior differences among German, French, and Spanish customers.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Identifying distinct customer segments based on demographic and behavioral patterns.
