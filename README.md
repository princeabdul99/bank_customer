# Project Background
**Bank Customer Churn**

Account information for 10,000 customers at a European bank, including details on their credit score, balance, products, and whether they have churned.

This project utilizes data visualization techniques to uncover insights into customer churn and behavior within a bank.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Churn Attributes and Predictability:** dentifying attributes that are more prevalent among churners compared to non-churners and assessing the predictive power of the available variables.
- **Customer Demographics:** Analyzing the overall demographic profile of the bankâ€™s customers to understand key characteristics. 
- **Regional Behavior Differences:** Exploring account behavior differences among German, French, and Spanish customers.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Identifying distinct customer segments based on demographic and behavioral patterns.

# Executive Summary

### Overview Findings

The analysis highlights key regional differences in customer behavior and their correlation with churn. German customers have the highest average account balances ($119.73k) and a balanced gender ratio, making them ideal for premium services and wealth management strategies. Conversely, Spain faces challenges with the highest proportion of customers with zero account balances (1,199) and a significant low-income demographic (10.7%), requiring targeted financial inclusion initiatives. France leads in inactive customers (48.33%), signaling an opportunity for re-engagement campaigns. Across regions, tenure is stable, with most customers having 6+ years, offering a solid base for loyalty and retention programs.

Churn analysis further reveals that churners have a higher proportion of inactive customers (63.92%) and slightly lower credit scores (646 vs. 653). Churners are more evenly distributed geographically, with higher concentrations in Germany (39.96%) and Spain (20.27%), compared to non-churners who are predominantly from France. Gender dynamics also play a role, as churners include more females (55.92%) than non-churners (42.75%).
